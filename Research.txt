A* algorithm gives the optimal path, works on a node graph
If we can "nodeify" our maze, we can use A* to find the path
We don't necesarly need the fastest path, so we could try BFS
with no optimization, shouldn't take long (very small maze)

make path better: Quatree
we take the first generated path and subdivide all of the node, and the adjacent ones too, and rerun the pathfinding on them.
